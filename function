        JS is a functional programming language.
        Function is a reusable piece of code that can be written once and
        used as many times as we want.

        in function there are two things to be remembered: 
            1) function declaration -> here function is created which can be later used.
            2) function invocation/call -> this is a function call/use.

        there are two ways in which a function can be declared in JS:

        1) using function keyword(traditional way of function declaration):

            syntax:
            function function_name(parameters){
                // actual function implementation
            } 

            //call
            function_name();
        
        2) using arrow syntax:

            syntax: 
                var function_name = (parameters) => {
                    // actual function implementation
                }

                function_name();

        3) function expression:

                var function_name = function(parameters){
                    // actual function implementation
                }

        Pure Function:
                this is not a type of function but it is concept.

            a pure function takes inputs(arguments), produces an result but never
             modifies or depends on any external variables outside its scope.
